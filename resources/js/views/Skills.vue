    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>I am a full-stack web developer with over three years of experience.</p> 
    <p>I have maintained, developed and launched multiple projects from scratch, carrying the development of its' back-end and front-end codebases.</p>
    <p>My current toolset includes Elixir Lang & Phoenix Framework, Ruby & Ruby on Rails, React, Redux, Angular, TypeScript, Docker and all the other various frameworks, libraries and technologies related to them.</p>
    <p>Feel free to ask me any questions. I can help you in your project in all from the UI mockups, back-end and front-end web development to fixing the design and installing & configuration of the application on staging/production enviroments.</p>
    <p><i>Call me a Swiss Army Knife in terms of web development.</i></p>

    <h3>Front-end Web Development</h3>
    <p>I specialise in applications written in React and Angular. Recently I became also a huge fan of one-way data flow and Redux-like architecture and also typed languages, e.g. TypeScript.</p>

    <p>My current experience and skills in front-end include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            lead TypeScript/JavaScript development: bootstraping or refactoring an existing app architecture, by improving its' extensibility and reliability;
            </li>
            <li>
            full integration of front-end development using tools like <a href="https://webpack.js.org/" rel="nofollow">Webpack</a> with features like automatic code reload, code minifications, multiple environments support,
            </li>
            <li>
            good sense of design and UX, by having some small past experience in graphic design
            </li>
            <li>
            knowledge and huge experience in many JS ecosystem, by using many libraries like React, Redux, Redux-Observable, RxJS, Angular, Ionic Framework, Backbone, jQuery, Lodash/Underscore and whatever else was needed.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Back-end Web Development</h3>
            <p>In back-end development, my current stack involves Elixir and Phoenix Framework, and alternatively Ruby on Rails or NodeJS.</p>
            <p>Nearly every app I have done in the past had the back-end written also by me. In order to improve the development speed, performance and reliability, I have changed languages and frameworks already multiple times, from PHP to Ruby and now to Elixir.</p>

            <p>Luckily, my experience and lessons I learned while doing all those apps, will stay with me and be useful forever, no matter what framework I will use in the next project.</p>
            <p>What I can do is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                lead development of web apps in Elixir/Ruby
                </li>
                <li>
                cooperation with APIs, remote data synchronizations, cloud servers, asynchronous workers
                </li>
                <li>
                using different types of databases (like <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/" rel="nofollow">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="http://www.mysql.com/" rel="nofollow">MySQL</a>, <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/" rel="nofollow">Elasticsearch</a>, <a href="http://redis.io/" rel="nofollow">Redis</a>)
                </li>
                <li>
                dividing the servers into different machine nodes / docker containers; database sharding; load balancing
                </li>
                <li>
                refactoring existing applications, by improving code readibility, separating concerns into separate functions and classes, splitting out the business logic from app's views and controllers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design" rel="nofollow">DDD</a>), and moving the app architecture into more event-based one
                </li>
                <li>
                writing unit and e2e tests
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Thus, not only I have coded their back-end and front-end code, but often I also had to care about other things needed in a successful web application:</p>

<script>
    export default {
        mounted() {
            console.log('Component mounted.')
        }
    }
</script>
